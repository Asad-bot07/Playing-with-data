# Matplotlib is a python library for creating static and interactive, animated graph to plot our data for data visualization

# importing matplotlib

# Basic coords
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
y = [90, 70, 75, 43, 39, 24, 16, 3, 0]

plt.plot(x, y) # to plot data in the graph
plt.show() # to visualize the plotted data
