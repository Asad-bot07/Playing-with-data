# Playing with datas

This repository is created for **learning, practicing, and revising the core technologies** required in the journey of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.

It serves as a structured space to strengthen fundamentals before diving deeper into advanced AI/ML concepts. The content here reflects hands-on learning, experimentation, and concept reinforcement rather than production-ready implementations.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- Build a strong foundation for AI/ML
- Revise essential Python-based tools used in data handling and analysis
- Practice concepts through small scripts and experiments
- Track progress while transitioning into AI/ML learning

This repository will be continuously updated as the learning journey progresses.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Covered (So Far)

- **Python** – Core programming concepts and logic building
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing and array operations
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization and plotting

More tools and libraries will be added as the journey advances into machine learning and deep learning.
